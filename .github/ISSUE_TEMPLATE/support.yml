        **Before submitting, please check these common solutions:**
        
        ### âœ… Common Issues & Solutions
        - **Addon not showing**: Make sure you're in a raid group and not in combat
        - **No adjustment buttons**: Check that you're an officer (rank 0-2) in "Spectrum Federation" guild
        - **Commands not working**: Try `/slh help` to see all available commands
        - **Data not syncing**: Use `/slh refresh` to refresh officer status
        
        ### âœ… Debug Commands for Self-Help
        - **Check status**: `/slh status` - Shows addon version, guild, officer status
        - **Refresh addon**: `/slh refresh` - Refreshes officer status and UI
        - **Enable debug**: `/slh debuglog on` - Enables detailed logging
        - **View recent logs**: `/slh debuglog show 10` - Shows last 10 debug entries
