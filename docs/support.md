### Example Bug Report

```markdown
**Bug Description:**
Roll counts not syncing between officers during raid

**Expected Behavior:**
When an officer adjusts a player's roll count, it should immediately 
appear on all other players' interfaces

**Actual Behavior:**
Changes only appear locally, other players see old counts

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Start raid with multiple officers running SLH
2. Officer A adjusts Player X's count using arrow buttons
3. Officer B's interface still shows old count for Player X
4. `/slh refresh` doesn't fix the sync issue

**Environment:**
- SLH Version: 0.3.3
- WoW Version: 10.2.5
- Officers affected: 3/4 in raid
- Regular members: Seeing mixed data

**Debug Info:**
[Paste output from `/slh debuglog export`]
```

## üìã Frequently Asked Questions

### Installation & Setup

**Q: Can I use SpectrumLootTool in other guilds?**
A: The addon is designed specifically for Spectrum Federation and requires guild membership for full functionality.

**Q: Do I need to be an officer to use the addon?**
A: No, all guild members can view roll counts. Officer rank (0-2) is only required for adjustment controls.

**Q: Why don't I see the interface in dungeons?**
A: By default, the addon only works in raid groups. Enable "Outside Raid" in settings to use it elsewhere.

### Functionality

**Q: How do roll counts work?**
A: Lower numbers = higher loot priority. Counts increase when you receive BiS loot and can be adjusted by officers.

**Q: Can I see historical data for offline players?**
A: Yes, enable "Show All Players" in settings to see data for all guild members regardless of online status.

**Q: What happens if I leave and rejoin the guild?**
A: Your roll count data is preserved as long as you rejoin with the same character name.

### Technical Issues

**Q: The addon is causing memory issues, what should I do?**
A: Enable "Current Group Only" mode, disable debug logging, and consider using `/slh reset old` to clean up old data.

**Q: How do I backup my roll count data?**
A: Data is automatically saved to SavedVariables. You can export it with `/slh debuglog export` for backup purposes.
