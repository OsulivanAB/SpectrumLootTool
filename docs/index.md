# Spectrum Loot Helper

Spectrum Loot Helper manages Best-in-Slot roll counts and keeps a synchronized log
among Spectrum Federation guild members. Data changes broadcast to the raid so
every member stays up to date. A settings toggle lets players use the addon
outside raid groups if desired; when enabled, the UI still lists the current
player even when solo. Officers see arrow buttons on each row to increase or
decrease roll counts. Another option lets you unlock the frame and drag it
anywhere on the screen, with the position saved between sessions.
